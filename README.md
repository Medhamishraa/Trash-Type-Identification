# Trash-Type-Identification
This project focuses on identifying and classifying trash using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop an automated system that can detect different types of waste and categorize them efficiently for better waste management.

The model is built using TinyML framework and trained on a dataset of labeled trash images. It includes:
  - Data Augmentation to improve generalization.
  - CNN-Based Architecture for image classification.
  - Performance Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
